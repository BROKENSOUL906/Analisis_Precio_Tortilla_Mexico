# Analisis_Precio_Tortilla_Mexico
This project is an exploratory data analysis of tortilla prices in Mexico. I used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze data and uncover key trends. The analysis reveals a consistent upward price trend, significant regional disparities, and a difference in cost between local shops and supermarkets.
